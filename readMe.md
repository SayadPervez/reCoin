### Files above explained:
#### "F" series of files employ http protocol for communication. F9 being the latest version in the F-series, it has websites optimized for both Pc and Mobiles. However F-series is not connected to the database and the UI freezes on a HTTP request to the server. Due to these reasons the F-series of reCoin is officially terminated.
#### "S" series of files employ socket.io to communicate with the server and hence promising a better UI and also the project is connected to the DataBase. Mobile View is yet to be optimized for the S-series of reCoin.
