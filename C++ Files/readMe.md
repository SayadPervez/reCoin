```
Note:
"User credential are right means that the given password and username match."
"Make sure you use the exact names for C++ files."
"There should be only one single line print statement in the final program."
```

## C++ programs I need:
---
### 1) **getAmount.cpp** **`"username,password"`**
> This program must take username and password as cmd line arguements and print `**"amount"**` if the user credentials are right, else print a **"-x-x-x-"**.
---
### 2) **writeNewPwd.cpp** **`"username,newPassword"`**
> This program must take username and a newPassword as cmd line arguements and print **"success"** if a new password was written else print **"failure"** upon which DBMS system has to be reviewed. oldPassword is not necessary for resetting password since password resetting can only be done on a secure way through email OTP.
---
### 3) **addCoin.cpp** **`"username,password,amountToBeAdded"`**
> This program must take username, password and amountToBeAdded as cmd line arguements and print **"amount after adding"** if user credentials are right else print a **"-x-x-x-"**.
---
### 4) **removeCoin.cpp** **`"username,password,amountToBeRemoved"`**
> This program must take username, password and amountToBeRemoved as cmd line arguements and print **"amount after subtracting"** if user credentials are right else print a **"-x-x-x-"**.
---
### 5) **transferCoin.cpp** **`"usernameA,usernameB,amountToBeTransferred"`**
> Tranfer coins **from "usernameA" to "userNameB"**. Password is not necessary for transferring since transferring Coins can only be done on a secure way through email OTP.
---
### z) **recalculateHash.cpp**
### **`"This block chain function will be added once all DBMS work is completed"`**
